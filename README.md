# LETTERBOXD CLON PAGE
This is a letterboxd.com Home and Profile Section Page Clon. The reason i did this website in particular and not another one is because i love films and letterboxd is a great app and website to log and reviews them. 
The website is only the design bit. It means is not functional like the original website https://letterboxd.com/ . The only clickable link is the profile section that says "facubeck" and the letterboxd logo to go to the home section.
